# Preface 

This book teaches database programming for scientific applications.
Here, databases are used to communicate and enforce data structures that reflects the logic and flow of a scientific study shared among multiple collaborators.

Scientific databases must handle massive numerical arrays and complex data structures. 
Also, the data must be linked with the computational code used its processing and analysis. 
Code management must be combined with automated computations orchestrated on diverse computational platforms.

Today there exists a large variety of available data models and approaches for data management. 
Among these, relational databases provide the most principled and best established data model for structured data. 
The relational model provides a wide range machanism for data integrity and consistency, expressive and performant data queries, 
Remarkably, the entirity of the  relational data model is dominated by a single programming language---SQL---with sublanguages for data definition, queries, modifications, and procedures. 

Designed largely in the 1970s and 80s, with continual updates and improvements, SQL is one of the most successful standardization efforts, powering a true revolution in databases.  

DataJoint provides a more modern implementation of the relational model. 

This books aims to provide a definitive summary of DataJoint principles and practice.
The book introduces general relational database programming in both DataJoint and SQL and I use the book to teach the {\em Database Systems} course at the University of St. Thomas in Houston.
