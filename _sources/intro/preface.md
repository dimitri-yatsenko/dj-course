# Preface 

## The Essence of Scientific Database Programming 
This guide offers insights into the world of database programming tailored for scientific contexts. 
Within these pages, you'll discover how databases can be harnessed to define and maintain the intricate structures and pathways inherent in collaborative scientific research.

Handling vast numerical datasets and intricate data configurations is the hallmark of scientific databases. 
But it's not just about storage. 
The data needs to seamlessly integrate with the computational algorithms responsible for its processing and interpretation. 
This necessitates a blend of adept code management and the automation of computations across diverse computing environments.

## The Relational Database Landscape: SQL and DataJoint
The panorama of data management is vast, dotted with myriad data models and methodologies. 
Yet, standing tall among them are relational databases, renowned for their disciplined approach to structured data organization. 
They are the guardians of data integrity and offer robust mechanisms for querying data efficiently and expressively. 
Interestingly, the vast realm of relational databases speaks predominantly one language---SQL. 
This versatile language branches out into subdomains dedicated to data definition, querying, modification, and procedural tasks.

Though SQL, a product of the 70s and 80s, reigns supreme in the database world, it's not without its intricacies. Enter DataJointâ€”a contemporary embodiment of the relational model, refined and optimized for the scientific community. Mirroring SQL, DataJoint too features sublanguages that cater to data definition, manipulation, and queries. The beauty of DataJoint lies in its simplicity, enabling users to master database programming without delving deep into SQL's complexities.

This guide elucidates the principles and applications of relational databases, casting DataJoint in the leading role, juxtaposed occasionally with its venerable predecessor, SQL.
It covers the theoretical foundations---relational theory---with practical examples, exercises, and resources.

## Target Audience
This volume serves as a foundational text for those keen on unraveling the nuances of relational database programming. 
It seamlessly bridges DataJoint and SQL, forming the core curriculum for the semester-long Database Systems course I teach at the University of St. Thomas, Houston.
